# This example will send a couple of commands to our device, which will respond
# accordingly, to showcase a product's actual usage.
#
# In this particular example the device we are testing is a Smart Switch, which
# responds by toggling one of its pins On of Off based on the command.

# The goal of this example is to show you how you can send a network commands to
# your devices through the AWS device communication infrastructure, and read a
# device's output's to verify its response, using our Testboard.
#
# This is one real world example of a very simple functional test you would run
# for your devices.
