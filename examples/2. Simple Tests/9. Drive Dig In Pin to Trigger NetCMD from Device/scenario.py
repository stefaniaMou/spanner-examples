# This example will toggle one of our device's inputs, which will respond
# accordingly by sending a network command, to showcase a product's actual usage.
#
# In this particular example the device we are testing is a Water Flooding
# Alarm, which responds by sending an "alarm_triggered" command with a value of
# "water" when the water flooding sensor pin is triggered.

# The goal of this example is to show you how you can receive network commands
# to your devices through the AWS device communication infrastructure, after
# setting one of the device's environmental inputs.
#
# This is one real world example of a very simple functional test you would run
# for your devices.
